# Emotional Intelligence Skills

This a brief list on skills are needed to have high emotional intelligence

1. Self-awareness: knowing one's strengths, weakness, drivers, values, and impact on others
2. Self-regulation: controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods
3. Motivation: being driven to ahieve for the sake of achievement. A passion to work for reasons that go beyond money or status.
4. Empathy: understanding other people's emotional breakup. Considering others' feelings, especially when making decisions.
5. Social skill: building rapport with others to move them in desired directions (persuasiveness).


## Leadership

The leader's mood and behaviours drive the moods and behaivors of everyone else. A cranky boss creates a toxic organization filled with negativeness. An inspirational, inclusive leader spawns acolytes for whom any challenge is good. The final link in the chain is performance: profit or loss. 

Because tense or terrifeid employees can be very productive in the short term, their organizations may post good results, but they never last. The emotional intelligence is carried through an organization like electricity through wires. To be more specific, the leader's mood is quite literally contagious, speading quickly and inexorably throughout the business. Being an emotional leader means understading your impact on others.

Managing one's inner life is not easy, of course. For many of us, it's our most difficult challenge. That's not to say that leaders can't have a vada day or week: Life happens. A leader must first attend to the impact of his mood and behaviors before moving on to his wide panoply of other critial responsibilites. 

Research suggest thtat our range of emotional skills is relatively set by our mid-20's and that our accompanying behaviors are, by that time, deep-seated habits. The more we act a certain way, the more the behavior becomes ingraind in our brains, and the more we will continue to feel and act that way. That's why emotional intelligence matters so much for a leader. An emotionally intelligente leader can monitor his or hers moods thought self-awareness, change them for the better thought self management, understand their impact through empathy, and act in ways that boost others' moods through relationship management.

### How to Change ?

1. Who do I want to be? Imagine yourself as a highly effective leader. What do you see?
2. Who are you know? To see you leadership style as others do, gather 360-degree feedback, especially from peers and subordinates. Identify your weaknesses and strengths.
3. How do you get from here to there? Devise a plan for closing the gap between who you are and who you want to be.
4. How do I make a change stick? Repeatedly rehearse new behaviors, physically and mentally - until they are automatic.
5. Who can help you ? Don't try to build your emotional skills alone - identify others who can help you naviate this difficult process. managers formed learning groups that helped them strengthen their leadershp abilities by exchanging frank feedback and dveloping mutual trust.

## Why it's so hard to be fair

Each employe decides for themlselve whether a decision has been made fairly. There are three drivers of process fairness. 

1. How much input employees believe they have in the decision-making process.
2. How employees believe decisions are made and implemented.
3 How managers behave.

Process fariness doesn't ensure that employees will always get what they want; but it does mean that hey will have a change to be heard. When people feel hurt by their companies, they tend to retailate. And when they do, it can have grave consequences. In addition to reducing legal costs, fai process cuts down on employee theft and turnover. Work environments in which employees jave a high degree of operational autonomy lead to the highers degree of creativity and innovation. Operational autonomy, of course can be seen as the extreme version of process fairness. Creativity and innovation tendo to suffer in work environments characterized by low levels of process fairness, such as when employees believe that the organizatino is strictly controller by upper management or when they believe that their ideas will be summarily dismissed.
