# Emotional Intelligence Skills

This a brief list on skills are needed to have high emotional intelligence

1. Self-awareness: knowing one's strengths, weakness, drivers, values, and impact on others
2. Self-regulation: controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and moods
3. Motivation: being driven to ahieve for the sake of achievement. A passion to work for reasons that go beyond money or status.
4. Empathy: understanding other people's emotional breakup. Considering others' feelings, especially when making decisions.
5. Social skill: building rapport with others to move them in desired directions (persuasiveness).
